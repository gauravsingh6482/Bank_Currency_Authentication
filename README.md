# Bank_Currency_Authentication
Bank_Currency_Authentication


The task here is to predict whether a bank currency note is authentic or not based on four attributes i.e. variance of the image wavelet transformed image, skewness, entropy, and curtosis of the image.


This is a binary classification problem and we will use a random forest classifier to solve this problem. Steps followed to solve this problem will be similar to the steps performed for regression.
